let´s implement the changes and build the entire app. 

make sure all is working and that we have two separated folder for frontend and backend under the CarouselOptimizer folder.

think that we have the correct Separation of Concerns and the code is clean and simple in general.
Follow good coding practices.

Add unit and integration tests for backend.

And after implementing we also need all steps to push this to github and be able to deploy both servers.

How can we configure IaC or cloud changes?
PLease include all required configuration.

Add a logger wrapper for each project to send logs for all functions to be able to debug if required.

For backend use a simple Python framework. 

Lets add a command to set up the app in local.

AFter the code is implemented I want to try it in local, so we need to write a read me file with the detailed instructions. A junior dev should be able to set it up.

Also, lets make a file for the deployment structions for each service
